It has encouraged a blunt-edged, security-oriented approach that allows little space to tackle the root causes of violence and has even lent targeted groups credibility as resistance movements. Armed organisations such as Al-Shabab and Hamas have used the labelling strategically to raise their status within their constituency and enhance their perceived victimhood.", "Moreover, while the objective of blacklisting is to contain security threats, it has not succeeded in hurting listed armed groups in material terms. To be effective, policies would need to be tailored to specific local circumstances, but these regimes stress uniformity. The anti-terror blacklisting mindset has also made international policy lose sight of a cental conflict dynamic: state violence. Western governments and international organisations have found themselves aligned with and supporting dubious military and policing strategies, often accompanied by human rights violations, in the name of combating blacklisted groups. Accordingly, they end up pouring more fuel on the fire of such conflicts.", "It is time to change this failed policy of blacklisting, which merges the actor and the act of terrorism.

One genetic change, the P681H mutation, is found in the Alpha variant first detected in Kent and has been linked to faster transmission.

It distracted the attention of US policymakers and the resources of its security agencies. The war to oust Saddam Hussein, justified in part by a fallacious link between al-Qaida and the Iraqi regime, appeared to vindicate many of Bin Laden’s arguments and prompted a vast surge of anger across the Islamic world. It also opened a new front, which allowed al-Qaida to get back in the fight.", "It did not allow al-Qaida to win, however. The wave of violence unleashed by militants through the middle of the post-9/11 decade aimed to terrorise enemies, radicalise existing members and mobilise new support. It may have achieved the first two goals – at least in part – but not the third. As each new campaign erupted in the Middle East – in Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, ", " – the extremists lost any sympathy among the general population. By 2010, Bin Laden was so concerned about how the repeated massacres of other Muslims had tarnished the al-Qaida brand that he pondered changing its name – and sent out fierce injunctions to subordinates to dial down the violence. Once again, the pendulum was swinging against al-Qaida, but it would swing back again.", "But 2011 was particularly bad for the group. Bin Laden was killed in a US special forces raid on his home in the northern Pakistani town of Abbottabad, and half a dozen other senior figures in the organisation died or were detained too.", "In the weeks before his death Bin Laden worried that he, his organisation and their thinking had been marginalised by the upheaval of the Arab spring. The crowds in Cairo’s Tahrir square and elsewhere in the Middle East were shouting for democracy, not for a rigorous Islamic regime. In the end it was Bin Laden’s successor, ", ", an older Egyptian former paediatrician and veteran extremist who found a way to exploit the sudden chaos, and restore al-Qaida’s fortunes.", "Zawahiri had an undistinguished career as an extremist leader, lacked charisma and was not well liked within either al-Qaida or the broader jihadist movement. But he immediately demonstrated an unsuspected strategic talent and ability to learn the lessons of previous decades. The main innovation of Bin Laden in the late 1990s had been to direct its full resources against the “far enemy” – the US and the west – not the “near enemy – local governments in the Middle East. Bin Laden’s first ventures in this direction had come when he had targeted US forces in Yemen in 1991, but matured seven years later with massive, ", "swiftly followed by ", ". These efforts culminated in the 9/11 attacks, which were deeply controversial within his organisation and opposed by many of its secondary leaders.", "Zawahiri turned away from this strategy, making it clear that the far enemy was no longer a priority, partly because such attacks had become much harder and partly because of the response they would be likely to provoke. He also moved al-Qaida away from its doctrine of “only jihad”, stressing the importance of building ties with local communities across the Islamic world which felt under threat.", "If al-Qaida could provide protection, security, even governance, then it could build grassroots support and extend its reach. The new strategy soon brought results, bringing new influence and recruits in the Sahel, east Africa, Yemen and in Afghanistan, where a new effort was made to build ties with the Taliban, which would be of crucial importance a decade later.", "Then, in 2014, a new challenge emerged: a breakaway group which rejected Zawahiri’s authority entirely. It first called itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, then, once it had seized a swath of land across those two countries and announced the establishment of a caliphate, simply ", ".", "This could have been a disaster for al-Qaida. ", " was much quicker to exploit the opportunities offered by the stunning spread of social media and smartphones, and appeared to have already achieved the long-term goal that al-Qaida had been striving towards. But the brutality of the newcomers, combined with Zawahiri’s more pragmatic strategy, combined to give al-Qaida the makeover Bin Laden had pondered before his death.", "Compared to Islamic State’s spectacular sadism, even al-Qaida seemed less bloodthirsty. A key text for both groups was a manual to jihad ambiguously entitled The Management of Savagery. The two interpreted its advice differently. Islamic State and its growing number of affiliates believed the title suggested the uses of extreme brutality while al-Qaida thought it meant the need to control violence. As Bin Laden had done, Zawahiri also steered his organisation away from both the sectarianism and the apocalyptic millenarianism of its rival. When Islamic State’s caliphate collapsed in 2019, al-Qaida was well positioned to claim the leadership of the global jihadist movement once again. It has not done this yet – and Islamic State still contests the role, sometimes violently – but has regained much ground. The fall of Afghanistan to its long-term allies, the Taliban, has provided a further boost.", "Ten days after the Taliban seized Kabul, al-Qaida issued a statement congratulating the movement on its “great victory against the crusader alliance”, an echo of the first declarations of war on the west broadcast by Bin Laden 25 years before. This was on behalf of all Muslims, and a “prelude to the liberation of Palestine … the Levant, Somalia, Yemen, Kashmir”, the group said, underlining its global ambitions but also local focus. For the al-Qaida leadership, “the defeat of the US places the global jihad into a new phase”.", "It is too early to tell if this last statement is true. But we can guess one thing.", "Al-Qaida has survived 33 years because it has evolved. Throughout its bloody history, it has changed with the times. Despite the grand ambitions of its founders, the organisation was originally parochial in its focus, with Saudi Arabia, Bin Laden’s birthplace, prominent among its targets. To propagate its ideology, it sought to execute massive attacks that would get the attention of traditional media, then the sole way to reach a mass audience. ", " then turned on the far enemy and prosecuted a truly world-spanning campaign through a decade and a half that was characterised everywhere by unprecedented globalisation.", "Their communications strategy was re-engineered to match the new capabilities of satellite networks, and the group took full advantage of the now ubiquitous internet to assist with management of a sprawling organisation and attack planning. Over the last 10 years, as that wave of globalisation has ebbed in the face of economic crises and resistance to the erosion of cultural identities, al-Qaida has evolved again, pivoting neatly to something much more local – and understood that in the new media environment, complex plots work less well than “leaderless” attacks inspired through social media.", "The Arabic word chosen as a name for the group back in the late 1980s suggested many things: an organising principle or the solid foundation of a building are two possible interpretations – but above all a military base. This was how these men had referred to the fortified camp from which they had just repulsed the Soviets in the first true battle of their campaign. It was also how irregular fighters and armies had referred to strongholds for much longer, both in Afghanistan and across much of the Islamic world. The difference was that al-Qaida would not be a mere geographical location, but an international, ideological aspiration.", "The chances of fulfilling this ambition of creating a vanguard of Islamic fighters who will raise the Muslim world in a vast uprising against unbelieving local rulers and the west too remain extremely slim and the prospects for those still committed to the project unclear. Zawahiri is ailing, or maybe already dead, and no one knows who his successor might be or what he might do. But history suggests that to write off al-Qaida, even after 33 years, would be very optimistic."]},
